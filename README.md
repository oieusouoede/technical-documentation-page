# freeCodeCamp - Technical documentation page
This is not an official documentation for Python, this my solution to the technical documentation page challenge for the freeCodeCamp certificaton. 
Its basically a reproduction of the example page because I'm lazy.

Also it was a very boring process cause once I set the page structure right (wich took me like 20 minutes or so) I had to spend the rest of the day searching content to populate the page. I know they only asked for a few code and ul tags but I couldn't just go halfway through it. 

Anyway, here it is. The page is hosted on my [codepen account as usual](https://codepen.io/edesoares/full/NWgKPXz).

Next challenge is the portfolio page which I've been looking forward to do since it is the page I'll want to show off everywhere.

Be safe and take your vaccines.\
